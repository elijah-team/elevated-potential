Elijah elevated-potential
==========================

Elijah is:

- ... a high-level language built to explore \[insert goal here\].
- ... a historical curiosity.
- ... meant to be easy to use standalone or with existing projects.
- ... free software (LGPL) intended for use on all systems, aka Linux.
- ... philosophically opposed to semicolons

`elevated-potential` is:

- ... implemented in Java (17, for now; 8 is great and Graal is you paal)
- ... of the impression that build systems don't matter (tldr maven for now)
- ... mortal enemies of Scala and Kotlin
- ... philosophically excited about Clojure (and Xtend nad EMF/MBSE)
- ... also secretly jealous of Lombok and AOP
