/**
 * <p>Prompt:
 * <p>
 * <p>Write a javadoc for this class and summarize the usages of the instances of this exception in the javadoc</p>
 * <p>
 * <p>MachinetAI:
 * <p>
 * <p>Certainly! Here's an updated Javadoc for the UnintendedUseException class, including a summary of its usages:
 * <pre>
 * The UnintendedUseException class represents an exception that is thrown when a method or operation is used in
 * an unintended way.
 * This exception is a subclass of the RuntimeException class, which means it is an unchecked exception and does
 * not need to be declared in a method's throws clause.
 * 
 * Example usage:
 * <code>
 * try {
 *     // Perform some operation
 * } catch (UnintendedUseException e) {
 *     // Handle the exception
 * }
 * </code>
 * 
 * This exception can be used to indicate situations where a method or operation is being used incorrectly or in a way
 * that was not intended by the developer. It can be thrown to signal that the current state or context of the program
 * does not allow the requested operation to be performed.
 * 
 * Instances of this exception can be thrown in various scenarios, such as:
 * - When a method is called with invalid arguments or parameters.
 * - When a method is called in an incorrect sequence or order.
 * - When a method is called on an object that is not in a valid state.
 * - When a method is called in a context where it is not supported or allowed.
 * 
 * It is recommended to catch and handle this exception in a try-catch block to gracefully handle the error and provide
 * appropriate feedback or recovery options to the user.
 * </pre>
